== Biblio

An app that creates a digital bookshelf that users can add books to. Each user can add books manually, or enter an ISBN, which triggers a call to the Goodreads API to generate the book data automatically.

Biblio includes a join table that keeps track of the book id and user idea, so the book will persist in the database even if a user decides to remove the book from his own bookshelf.

Extensions to improve functionality include:
- Adding admin functionality so that books with errors or accidental duplicates (if one is entered by ISBN and the other manually) can be deleted easily.
- Adding logic that makes a manually added photo take precedence over the Goodreads photo, since many times the Goodreads generated photo is just a placeholder.
